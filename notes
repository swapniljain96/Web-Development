1. We have 4 types of Display
    *Block
    *Inline
    *Inline-Block
    *None : that get rid of our element

2.to remove some element from our page we can do it in 2 ways
    a) display:none;
        = it just remove the element and remove space it occupied

    b)visibility: hidden;
        = it just hide the element and space it still occupied
